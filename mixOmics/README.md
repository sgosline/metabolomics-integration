# README

Welcome to the MANA Metabolomics Integration workbook! This workshop leverages two primary pathways, the [mixOmics](http://mixomics.org/) package and the [PCSF](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005694) R package. MixOmics is designed to support you in all stages of multiomic analysis, and PCSF can help you integrate known features.
